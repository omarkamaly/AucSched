# AucSched
Our App is going to be called AucSched, From the name it will be an app that will try to make the life of freshmen a lot easier, as they are in their first year and do not know exactly what courses to register or in what order. The app will take the prefixes used by the university to describe each course and will convert the day names into their normal names for example ‘UW’ will be converted to Sundays and Wednesdays and finally the final product will be a schedule of the courses taken for this semester for example in a table format that will be easier to read for the freshmen students.  The idea is to have a simple application to simplify the scheduling of courses for new comers to the university.
The application will have reminders for courses that you have taken and will have the eligibility of printing the schedule. Students will input the description of each course as specified and the application will simply sort the courses in a generic way that is understood by everyone. 
Application Featuers:
-	Automated Reminders
-	Printing the Schedule
-	Alerts (if a course you need is available)
